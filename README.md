# Hangman-Game
It's January 2021. We're in the middle of a pandemic. I was quaranteening for the Winter.
I couldn't think of a better time to yet again teach myself Python. 
This time I had a plan...to follow the 100 days of code - albeit loosely.
This time I decided to document it using the Notion app.
During the first 30 days I used Udemy, YouTube and Google to teach myself the basics
During the next 30 days I decided to do my first project - the Hangman Game. 
Countless hours and versions later and almost quitting more than I care to admit, I finished the game. 
The good news is - it's no longer getting errors. I was able to successfully debug and troubleshoot them on my own (well...with a little help from my BFF Google of course).
The bad news is the logic is a little problematic. 
Meaning - you can successfully guess the word or not and the hangman is drawn.
Meaning when you win or lose it doesn't stop.
Meaning I can't get out of the loop.
So I'm asking a few friends to provide feedback to this version. 
Can't wait to keep learning.
